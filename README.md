## Welcome to Schedule Builder + 
The idea of this project is to provide ease of access for CUNY students enrolling for their classes. Based on personal experience, it's a strenuous endeaver of having to look up a professor's name on RMP, ask other people how the class is, and gauging how heavy your courseload will be. By using metadata obtained from your schedule builder tab we aim to provide:
- Sentiment analysis on profesor's based on their RMP reviews
- A list of professors who've historically taught that class
- How heavy your overall schedule might be. 

These are all utilities we wish CUNY First's schedule builder would have.
